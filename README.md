# TFT Notes 13.8

## Infiniteam
### General notes
Infiniteam is strong early but weak mid-late without Ezreal 2*. Stabilize during the midgame power trough by itemizing Kaisa, TF, ASol, Garen, Ekko. Don't itemize ASol as it eats into item economy for Ezreal/Samira

### Augments
Probably dont cap out infiniteam unless playing
* Chronic hallucinations
* Recursion matrix
* Hyperbolic time chamber (with blue buff/shojin on lucian)
* Ultimate Ez augment
* Time and a half (with sword)
* Infiniteam +1

Do not take TF's hero augments unless given no other choice.

Without these augments, look to pivot into mech sureshots, mech threats, or standard legendary board

With Sivir or Lucian money printer look to fast-8. With Ezreal money printer look to fast-9.

Good supporting augments are
* Second wind
* Ascension
* Portable forge

### Items
#### Frontline
Because we are not guaranteed playing mech, mogs has significant value on this team.

BIS on the main tank is redemption/mogs/bramble/dclaw

Alternatives are:
* Gargoyles
* Protectors (on Garen)
* Locket (good use of rods)
* ZZRot

#### Backline
This comp is very sword hungry. Both Samira and Ezreal want to be itemized in the late game with sword items. You also need LW on Samira or Sivir, who can both spread the armor shred.

BIS on Ezreal is IE. Round out with DB, gunblade, GS.

Alternatives are:
* Guinsoos (scales with sureshots, mana generation)
* Edge of night (probably wont win out but keeps him safe from hackers)
* Shojin

#### Ornn items
* Manazane (Ezreal)
* Winter (main tank)
